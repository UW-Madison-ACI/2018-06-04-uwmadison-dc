Please go through all the installation steps below and make sure that
you not only installed them, but start them up to make sure they're working.
If you have any problems, don't hesitate to email the instructors to
ask for help, or arrive early on the first day of the workshop to
get help.

- **A spreadsheet program**

  For this workshop you will need a spreadsheet program. Many people already have
  Microsoft Excel installed, and if you do, you're set!

  If you need a spreadsheet
  program, there are a few other options, like OpenOffice and LibreOffice. Install
  instructions for LibreOffice, which is free and open source, are here.

  - **Download the Installer**

    Install LibreOffice by going to the [installation page](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/). The version for Mac
    should automatically be selected. Click on the button below "Main Installer" **Download Version x.y.z**. You
    will go to a page that asks about a donation, but you don't need to make one.
    Your download should begin automatically.

  - **Install LibreOffice**

    Once the installer is downloaded, double click on it and it should install.

  - To use LibreOffice, double click on the icon and it will open.

- **OpenRefine**

  OpenRefine (previously Google Refine) is a tool for data cleaning
  that runs through a web browser, and any browser -
  Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Explorer - should work fine.
  You will need to download Google Refine and install it,
  and when you open it, it will run through the browser, but you don't need
  an internet connection, and the data will all be stored on your computer.

  - Go to the OpenRefine [download page](http://openrefine.org/download.html)

  - Click on _Mac kit_ to download the install file

  - Open the downloaded .dmg file

  - Drag the icon in to the Applications folder
- Double click on the icon and Google Refine will then open in your web browser.
- If it doesn't open automatically, open a web broswer after you've started the program and go to the URL <code>http://localhost:3333</code> and you should see OpenRefine.

  In the workshop, we will use RStudio. RStudio is a nice interface to the
  programming language R. To use RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio.

    will download.
