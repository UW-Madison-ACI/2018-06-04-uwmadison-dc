## General Information

[Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org) workshops are for any researcher
who has data they want to analyze, and no prior computational experience is required.
This hands-on workshop teaches basic concepts, skills and tools for working more
effectively with data.

We will cover data organization in spreadsheets, OpenRefine, SQL for
data management, and R for data analysis and visualization.

For researchers who have already been programming and seek to expand their capabilities, our
UW-Madison [Software Carpentry workshop (Jun 6-7)](https://uw-madison-aci.github.io/2018-06-06-uwmadison-swc) will likely be more appropriate.
These two workshops are NOT intended to be taken back-to-back, and you can learn about
future workshops at UW-Madison by joining the [mailing list](http://wisc.us9.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c3aae71670855b66d79d170b8&id=6d65510fb6)
of UW-Madison's [Advanced Computing Initiative](http://aci.wisc.edu/).

**Who:**
  The course is aimed at UW-Madison-affiliated graduate students, staff, and other researchers.

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

To participate in a Data Carpentry workshop,
you will need working copies of the software described below.
Please make sure to install everything and try opening it to make sure it works
_before_ the start of your workshop. If you run into any problems,
please feel free to email the instructor or arrive early to your workshop on
the first day.

Participants should bring and use their own laptops to insure the proper setup of
tools for an efficient workflow once you leave the workshop.

This workshop will be using the software outlined in the install instructions below.
Please see the section for your operating system for those directions.

<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>

Please go through all the installation steps below and make sure that
you not only installed them, but start them up to make sure they're working.
If you have any problems, don't hesitate to email the instructors to
ask for help, or arrive early on the first day of the workshop to
get help.

  For this workshop you will need a spreadsheet program. Many people already have
  Microsoft Excel installed, and if you do, you're set!

  If you need a spreadsheet
  program, there are a few other options, like OpenOffice and LibreOffice. Install
  instructions for LibreOffice, which is free and open source, are here.

  - **Download the Installer**

    Install LibreOffice by going to the [installation
    page](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/).
    The version for Windows should automatically be selected.
    Click on the button below "Main Installer" **Download Version
    x.y.z**. You will go to a page that asks about a donation,
    but you don't need to make one. Your download should begin
    automatically.

  - **Install LibreOffice**

    Once the installer is downloaded, double click on it and it should install.

  - To use LibreOffice, double click on the icon and it will open.

- **OpenRefine**

  OpenRefine (previously Google Refine) is a tool for data cleaning
  that runs through a web browser, and any browser -
  Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Explorer - should work fine.
  You will need to download OpenRefine and install it,
  and when you open it, it will run through the browser, but you don't need
  an internet connection, and the data will all be stored on your computer.

  - Go to the OpenRefine [download page](http://openrefine.org/download.html)

  - Click on _Windows kit_ to download the install file

  - To use it, unzip, and double-click on openrefine.exe (if you're having issues
    with openrefine.exe try refine.bat instead)

  - OpenRefine will then open in your web browser.

  - If it doesn't open automatically, open a web broswer after
    you've started the program and go to the URL
    <http://localhost:3333> and you should see OpenRefine.
